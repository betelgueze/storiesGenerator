This app is a binary tree editor where data of a node are ascii strings
App can generate stories based on random traversal of a tree and there is a feature that adds insertions at the end of every tree node,
trees are stored each in separate file in a folder "./trees/" and insertions are in folder "./vsuvky/"
 every story and insertions file has tags and only insertions and stories with the same tag can be merged into a resulting story
with button save you save current story into memory
with button flush you save stories onto disk
with buttom generate program generates a random story
during generation there are multiple stories merged together so the resulting story is quite long
ENJOY!
